    "This is the Game of Nim\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy game from ancient times involving three groups of objects.\n",
    "In this version of Nim, the groups are made up of 3, 5 and 7 objects.\n",
    "The game is played by each player selecting objects to remove from the groups until there are no objects left.\n",
    "The rules are that players take turns in removing objects.\n",
    "Players may remove as many objects as they want each turn, but can only remove objects from one group each turn.\n",
    "The player who is forced to take the last piece is the loser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game you are playing against the computer which knows the best move in all possible board combinations.\n",
    "Where the computer cannot win, it will try to trick you into making a mistake.\n",
    "The computer changes its strategy slightly using random choices for some moves where it does not have a clear advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game has been programed into Python 3 using Tkinter for the GUI.\n",
    "If you do not have Tkinter installed, in cmd type \"python -m pip install tkinter\"\n",
